This is Android demo project used to compare performance of various JSON parser implementations in my blog post.

Right now it includes:
- Android built-in: http://developer.android.com/reference/org/json/package-summary.html
- JSON.simple: http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/
- Jackson: http://jackson.codehaus.org/

Results on my Nexus One and more information is available in my blog post at http://martinadamek.com
